# Django polling app

A small django project that allows users to create and complete surveys. A user must create a list of products/services
that he wants other users to bid on, and then creates a survey.

currently served via [a free heroku dyno](https://stock-polls.herokuapp.com) (so be patient with load times on first visit)

To respond a survey, select one from the list and input your price. Optionally leave a comment for the survey creator.

Front end is very bare bones for now, focus was on functionality. It's a pretty good fit for a React + Django Rest Framework,
and that's probably the next step.
